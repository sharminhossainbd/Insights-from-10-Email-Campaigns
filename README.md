## Test 10: Publisher Email-NA Issue

Emails were sent three times to publishers about their "not available" status before including it in a biweekly test. 
The first email was based on data from six months (October 2017 - March 2018). Those who did not open the email were sent a second email. 
The third email was sent regarding the May data on "not available."

- Total Emails Sent: 120
- Open Rate vs. Delivered Rate: 59.48%
- Response Rate vs. Open Rate: 14.49%

Among those who responded to the first six months of data (October 2017 - March 2018), all except one publisher had reduced "not available" numbers in April. 
Even in May and June, their "not available" numbers were lower than the average from the six months. 

For the third email (May 2018), those who responded did not reduce the "not available" numbers in June.

**Note:** Based on the response to this test, it had been included in the biweekly phase, and SMS notifications have been set up alongside emails. 
The entire process was being maintained manually; a proposal has been made to automate it.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlighted significant insights into customer engagement, revealing strong open and click rates but variable conversion to orders. Optimizing content and automating responses would enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Leveraging these insights would be crucial for refining our email marketing strategies and achieving better business outcomes.
